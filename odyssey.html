        <h2 class="project-h2">Context</h2>
        <p class="project-p">Odyssey2.0 is a Management Information System in the North American sector. My contributions encompassed three core aspects: first, crafting a comprehensive User Interface kit to strengthen the digital brand; second, developing an integrated design system by merging code components; and finally, serving as a User Interface designer. This ensured efficient development processes, higher scalability rates, and a cohesive, user-centric interface.</p>
    
        <h2 class="project-h2">Problem.</h2>
        <p class="project-p">This startup was experiencing rapid growth and was hiring many new members without having unified identity documents. This situation resulted in several problems: numerous inconsistencies across the application, a steep learning curve for newcomers, reduced scalability, and a delayed rollout of new components from design to development. All of these issues directly impacted the overall pace of the process.</p>

        <h2 class="project-h2">Solution.</h2>
        <p class="project-p">Establishing a design system would address the inconsistency issues, accelerate scalability rates, and serve as a foundation for building components within the application. We held a meeting with the Design System Principal at Oracle to gain a better understanding of how to tackle this significant challenge. Based on that meeting, we outlined a roadmap for creating our own design system.</p>

        <h2 class="project-h2">Process.</h2>
        <p class="project-p">So, alongside two front-end developers and two UX designers, I led the initiative to create the design system. This involved cataloging every single component used in the application, which included documenting rules and guidelines, providing documentation about the components, linking to the UI Kit in Figma, and organizing the Scss class components.</p>

        <h2 class="project-h2">Results (metrics).</h2>
        <p class="project-p">The results were astounding. We reduced our scalability time from two and a half months of a learning curve to just three weeks. This meant that any new developers or designers joining the team became <b>fully operational in almost a third of the time.</b> Additionally, we conducted surveys regarding the look and feel of the application, and in the congruency section, we achieved an impressive <b>94% customer satisfaction score.</b></p>
