            </h1>

            <h2 id="text1">
                'Carnal' is a robust project, featuring audio interviews accompanied by a photo of each 
                interviewee's hand. 
                <br>

                <br>
                The endeavor presented a couple of challenges. Firstly, automating the upload process for 
                the client's desired thousand interviews proved essential. To achieve this, we developed 
                an exclusive client-accessible internal database, allowing them to add, edit, or delete 
                interviews seamlessly.
                <br>

                <br>
                This meant creating a whole another website from scratch: the necessities and requirements of
                this database were not the same as for the main website. I opted for a very elegant and minimalist 
                look to avoid creating any unnecesary confusions to our client.
                <br>

                <br>
                Another major challenge was implementing a 3D interface for the homepage, as per the client's 
                request. Leveraging 'three.js', we successfully crafted a dynamic menu enabling users to select 
                their preferred interview for viewing.
                <br>

                <br>
                This interface was rotable on all axes and had zoom-in and zoom-out. This was the most challenging
                part because we had to balance this very modern approach and digest it down so it would be simple 
                enough for any person to know how to interact with it.
                <br>

                <br>
                Throughout the development process, my focus on user experience and effective communication with 
                our client allowed us to create a remarkable website that met their specific needs.

                Odyssey 2.0
            </h1>

            <h2 id="text2">
                Odyssey is a highly technical MIS designed to manage printing resources where I assumed the role of 
                a UI engineer.
                <br>

                <br>
                The initial hurdle was enhancing the website's visual friendliness. Given its technical nature, creating 
                a more accessible interface was crucial to balance the complexity of navigation. We tackled this by developing 
                an in-house UI kit that we later scaled up into a comprehensive design system.
                <br>

                <br>
                In this role, collaborating closely with the front-end team was essential to ensure that the custom-made interactions 
                in the original design were accurately deployed on the website. Working hand in hand, we successfully brought the 
                intended design to life, offering a seamless and engaging user experience.
                <br>

                <br>
                To further enhance the website's visual appeal and cater to our specific demographic, we embarked on the initiative of 
                redesigning the entire color scheme. Taking into account user feedback regarding legibility issues, we prioritized user 
                experience and ran each color through a contrast checker. 
                <br>

                <br>
                This undertaking represents the largest project I have been involved in, with a collaborative effort between 
                a sum of three teams that amounted to up to fifteen people, all working together to create a cutting-edge MIS tailored for 
                the North American printing sector.
                <br>

                <br>
                The combination of custom-made interactions, a carefully curated icon catalogue, and an improved color scheme resulted in a 
                website that delighted users and effectively communicated the brand's identity to its demographic.

                Atotonilco
            </h1>

            <h2 id="text3">
                I had the opportunity to work for the film studio Atotonilco, where I undertook the task of creating their 
                web identity from scratch. 
                <br>

                <br>
                In this role, I served as both a project manager and product designer. This required effective communication 
                skills to convey the technical capabilities of the development team to the client and the other way around. Moreover, 
                it was essential to make the website organized and elegant, to appeal to potential investors and donors.

                <br>

                <br>
                Throughout this project, I successfully navigated the complexities of managing communication and expectations between 
                the various stakeholders, resulting in a compelling and functional web platform that met the film studio's needs and 
                aspirations.
                <br>

                <br>
                In preparation for creating the visual identity, I conducted interviews with potential investors, film industry professionals, 
                and shareholders. These insights allowed me to establish the key characteristics of the brand's visual identity to further map
                out the demographic and developed a set of user personas, providing a solid foundation for the design process.
                <br>

                <br>
                Once the research phase was complete, I began the ideation stage, focusing on crafting a color scheme, icon catalogue, and website 
                mockups. All these elements needed to complement each other seamlessly and align with the company's vision of delivering a modern 
                and minimalist experience.

                <br>

                <br>
                The result was a brand image that communicated the company's values, attracted investors, and resonated with the film industry professionals, 
                ultimately contributing to the success and growth of the business.
