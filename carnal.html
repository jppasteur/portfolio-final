        <h2 class="project-h2">Context</h2>
        <p class="project-p">Carnal is a government-funded art collaboration between Mexico's Secretary of Culture and France's Société Civile des Auteurs Multimedia. In this project, my responsibility was to establish a comprehensive digital identity for two websites: a public interface designed to accommodate up to one thousand visitors per day, and an internal database system that allowed the client to input and retrieve information.</p>
    
        <h2 class="project-h2">Problem.</h2>
        <p class="project-p">Since this project was for an art installation, the requirements for the public interface were highly specific, emphasizing digital artistic experimentation over functionality. One of the key requirements was to construct a 3D interface capable of displaying around two hundred options that users could navigate by rotating in all axes. The second significant challenge was establishing the internal database system to enable the client to continually add new options to that interface.</p>

        <h2 class="project-h2">Solution.</h2>
        <p class="project-p">As the product manager, I undertook an extensive research process to make an informed decision regarding the technology to use for the 3D interface. I chose to work with the three.js framework and reached out to a full-stack developer experienced in using it. Additionally, I recognized that the public and internal interfaces had distinct objectives, necessitating separate visual identity documentation.</p>

        <h2 class="project-h2">Process.</h2>
        <p class="project-p">Once I had a clear vision for both websites, I began developing comprehensive UI Kits and guideline documentation. These documents were then used as the basis for creating fully functional prototypes, serving as both a proof-of-concept for the client and a template for the developer to follow. In the development using three.js, we placed a strong emphasis on ensuring responsiveness, translating all physical interactions and maintaining a legible ratio.</p>

        <h2 class="project-h2">Results (metrics).</h2>
        <p class="project-p">We initially delivered the project with two hundred entries in the database. Today, this database has grown to include over twelve hundred entries and continues to expand. The website has garnered attention in the news from both Mexico and France, being celebrated as a landmark in the realm of digital art installations. As the Product Designer, receiving recognition from my home country's Secretary of Culture serves as a badge of honor for the effort and the meticulous process we followed.</p>
