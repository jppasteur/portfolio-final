            </h1>

            <h2 id="text1">
                'Carnal' is a robust project, featuring audio interviews accompanied by a photo of each 
                interviewee's hand. 
                <br>

                <br>
                The endeavor presented a couple of challenges. Firstly, automating the upload process for 
                the client's desired thousand interviews proved essential. To achieve this, we developed 
                an exclusive client-accessible internal database, allowing them to add, edit, or delete 
                interviews seamlessly.
                <br>

                <br>
                Another major challenge was implementing a 3D interface for the homepage, as per the client's 
                request. Leveraging 'three.js', we successfully crafted a dynamic menu enabling users to select 
                their preferred interview for viewing.

                Odyssey is a highly technical MIS designed to manage printing resources where I assumed the role of 
                a UI engineer.
                <br>

                <br>
                The initial hurdle was enhancing the website's visual friendliness. Given its technical nature, creating 
                a more accessible UI was crucial to balance the complexity of navigation. We tackled this by developing 
                an in-house UI kit that we later scaled up into a comprehensive design system.
                <br>

                <br>
                This undertaking represents the largest project I have been involved in, with a collaborative effort between 
                a UX team, a UI team, and a development team, all working together to create a cutting-edge MIS tailored for 
                the North American printing sector.

                I had the opportunity to work for the film studio Atotonilco, where I undertook the task of creating their 
                web identity from scratch. 
                <br>

                <br>
                In this role, I served as both a project manager and product designer. This required effective communication 
                skills to convey the technical capabilities of the development team to the client and the other way around. Moreover, 
                it was essential to make the website organized and elegant, to appeal to potential investors and donors.

                <br>

                <br>
                Throughout this project, I successfully navigated the complexities of managing communication and expectations between 
                the various stakeholders, resulting in a compelling and functional web platform that met the film studio's needs and 
                aspirations.

            <h2 id="text4">
                I had the privilege of collaborating with a UX team and a front-end team to develop the design system for 
                the website Odyssey2.0. 
                <br>

                <br>
                Leading this endeavor brought forth various challenges and opportunities. I began by creating a comprehensive 
                UI kit that covered all the design and visual aspects of the project. This involved conducting a thorough inventory 
                of all the components used on the site and establishing clear rules for each of them.

                <br>

                <br>
                To enhance the code organization, we complemented the initial implementation with Scss class naming and we opted for 
                Notion as the platform to host our design system. This collective effort ultimately resulted in a well-structured and 
                visually appealing system that enhanced the user experience and facilitated future updates and scalability.

                <br>
                Given the delivery service's orientation towards the health sector, I incorporated specific guidelines into the 
                design process. This included developing a straightforward icon catalog and color palette that adhered to the company's 
                requirements. Additionally, I created various illustrative examples, following the same design principles.
                <br>

                <br>
                One of the highlights of the project was designing a 3D carousel interaction that showcased each member of the company.
                The end result was a modern and visually engaging web page and application that effectively catered to the company's 
                technological nature and its specific audience in the health sector.

                <br>
                The first challenge was to make the website more visually friendly. Because it is a very technical website,

            <h2 id="text7">
                I was comissioned to build a full video for the artist Zentiago. This project was challenging because I was
                in charge of every aspect of it, from the ideation up to editing and deliverying a finished product.
                <br>

                <br>
                The process had several phases; I started by scaning the artist through photogrammetry, and once I had the 
                3D models, I started to work on rigging and animation. The last step was creating textures and rendering.
                <br>

                <br>
                Through the use of photogrammetry I was able t oachieve a photo-realistic look that was alligned with the 
                artist's requirements. This photorealistic look could also be exploited for merchandise with 3D printing in a 
                nearby future.

                I collaborated on this project with the Los Angeles based studio Cherry Roma. My role on this project
                was to design and create a 3D isotype and mascot for the studio that could function as merchandise as well.
                <br>

                <br>
                Based off of some rough sketches they provided me with, I started designing, modelling and creating textures.
                I also got to rig the model and give it some animations. I also worked on an interactive model that had some
                commands such as: following the mouse and when hovered have an animation.
                <br>

                <br>
                 The studio also had the idea of making necklaces with the isotype for merchandise. So I also worked on some 
                 mockups using the 3D model with the purpose of visualizing the actual product.
