                In this project, my main focus was to develop an AR face recognition filter that would display a 3D object above the 
                user's head.
                <br>

                <br>
                For this specific project, I first designed the desired 3D object in Blender, ensuring it matched the client's requirements 
                and creative vision. Next, I seamlessly integrated the 3D object into a Spark AR Studio scene, carefully configuring all the 
                technical specifics to ensure smooth and accurate face recognition.
                <br>

                <br>
                Before becoming a social media filter, it was intended to become an app by using Unity and deploying it to the App 
                Store. But due to shortage in budget, it was decided then to go with a filter.

                In this project, I took on the task of designing an interactive model for the brand's isotype.
                <br>

                <br>
                Initially, the client requested MP4 and GIF files. However, as the project progressed, the client expressed the need 
                for an interactive version of the isotype. To fulfill this requirement, I decided to recreate the entire model using 
                Spline and introduced several different actions to enhance its interactive capabilities.
                <br>

                <br>
                The decision to recreate the model in Spline was deliberate. It allowed me to regain control over specific features 
                and capabilities that were lost during the import from Blender.
