            <h2 class="project-h2">Context</h2>
            <p class="project-p">DroneIQ is a drone delivery-service app in the healthcare industry. My responsibilities were centered on developing an MVP tailored to the client's needs, in close collaboration with two developers. A set of digital identity documents, including the UI Kit and design system, was provided. Furthermore, we delivered a proof of concept through fully functional Figma prototypes, utilizing the available development resources.</p>
        
            <h2 class="project-h2">Problem.</h2>
            <p class="project-p">The target users for this application belonged to a highly segmented niche with very specific requirements. Additionally, the client needed a fully functioning prototype that aligned with the available technical resources (time, number of developers, etc.) as a proof of concept before commencing full-scale development. This proof of concept would serve as a stand-in when presenting the concept to investors.</p>

            <h2 class="project-h2">Solution.</h2>
            <p class="project-p">Going through a really extense research was crucial not only to understand the expectative, but also to be able to empathize and to reflect the user-driven design across the application. I also realized that based on the time expectation, an MVP would outline the necessities and serve as guide of our objectives. Once the MVP was outlined, it would also be necessary to develop a full user documentation.</p>
    
            <h2 class="project-h2">Process.</h2>
            <p class="project-p">With only a full-stack developer as a consultant for technical resources, I began by conducting interviews with stakeholders who could potentially become users. Based on these interviews, I created a User Persona to empathize with and a User Story that outlined all the spaces and interactions. After conducting thorough research, we proceeded to create an interface that included a real-time tracker of drones in transit. This interface was based on a UI Kit constructed from Bootstrap elements.</p>

        <h2 class="project-h2">Results (metrics).</h2>
        <p class="project-p">When we presented the prototype along with all the documentation, we not only met the expected timeline but also, through extensive user research, managed to reduce expenses by almost a third of the original cost. The documentation would also prove invaluable for scalability and serve as a foundation for designers and developers as the project progressed.</p>
