                Odyssey 2.0
            </h1>

            <h2 id="text1">
                I had the privilege of collaborating with a UX team and a front-end team to develop the design system for 
                the website Odyssey2.0. 
                <br>

                <br>
                Leading this endeavor brought forth various challenges and opportunities. I began by creating a comprehensive 
                UI kit that covered all the design and visual aspects of the project. This involved conducting a thorough inventory 
                of all the components used on the site and establishing clear rules for each of them.
                <br>

                <br>
                During the creation of the user interface kit, we ensured that we also lay down several general rules and guidelines that 
                applied universally throughout the web page. These guidelines proved invaluable as they enabled new team members to adapt 
                more swiftly, streamlining their onboarding process.
                <br>

                <br>
                To enhance the code organization, we complemented the initial implementation with Scss class naming and we opted for 
                Notion as the platform to host our design system. This collective effort ultimately resulted in a well-structured and 
                visually appealing system that enhanced the user experience and facilitated future updates and scalability.
                <br>

                <br>
                We encountered opportunities to introduce new interactions for components for components that had basic or no animations 
                were revamped, leading to a polished and refined look across the entire design system. This iterative approach allowed us 
                to continuously improve upon existing components and maintain consistency in the user experience.
                <br>

                <br>
                This design system will continue to serve as a foundation for future projects, guaranteeing a seamless and efficient design 
                and development process for the team.

            </h1>

            <h2 id="text2">
                I had the opportunity to lead the design of a web page and application for an American 
                company offering drone delivery services.
                <br>
                
                <br>
                Given the delivery service's orientation towards the health sector, I incorporated specific guidelines into the 
                design process. This included developing a straightforward icon catalog and color palette that adhered to the company's 
                requirements. Additionally, I created various illustrative examples, following the same design principles.
                <br>

                <br>
                One of the highlights of the project was designing a 3D carousel interaction that showcased each member of the company.
                The end result was a modern and visually engaging web page and application that effectively catered to the company's 
                technological nature and its specific audience in the health sector.

                Understanding the preferences and expectations of the audience was crucial in shaping the brand's visual representation. 
                The research findings led me to design a color scheme that conveys a sense of eco-friendliness, trustworthiness, and 
                responsibility, aligning with the brand's values.
                <br>

                Moving forward, my focus shifted to creating the isotype and icons, essential for both physical and digital applications.
