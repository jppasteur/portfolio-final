                I was commissioned to create a music video for the artist Zentiago, from ideation to editing and final delivery.
                <br>

                <br>
                The process involved multiple phases, starting with scanning the artist using photogrammetry. Once I obtained the 
                3D models, I proceeded to work on rigging and animation, bringing the artist to life in the digital realm. The final 
                step in the process was creating textures and rendering the scenes.
                <br>

                <br>
                Leveraging photogrammetry allowed me to achieve a photo-realistic look that perfectly aligned with the artist's vision 
                and requirements. Throughout the project, I dedicated myself to ensuring that every element of the video was meticulously 
                crafted, resulting in a visually stunning and artistically meaningful finished product.

                Cherry Roma
            </h1>

            <h2 id="text2">
                I worked with the Los Angeles-based studio Cherry Roma, where my primary role was to design and create a 
                3D isotype and mascot.
                <br>

                <br>
                Starting with rough sketches provided by the studio, I delved into the design process, carefully crafting the isotype 
                and mascot in a 3D environment. One of the exciting aspects of this project was developing an interactive model with 
                various commands. This included features such as making the mascot follow the mouse and implementing hover animations.
                <br>

                <br>
                The studio's innovative idea of creating necklaces featuring the isotype for merchandise required further visualization.
                The resulting 3D isotype and mascot became versatile assets, serving both as a representation of the studio's identity 
                and as captivating merchandise for their enthusiastic audience.
