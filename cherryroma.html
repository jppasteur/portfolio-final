            <h2>
                Cherry Roma serves as the landing page for an audiovisual studio situated in the heart of the fashion sector, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. As a digital gateway, it encapsulates the studio's creative essence, offering a captivating introduction to their specialized services at the intersection of audio and visual artistry within the dynamic fashion landscape.

                <br>
                As a multifaceted contributor, I crafted the brand's distinctive 3D isotype, which also evolved into its endearing mascot. Simultaneously, I assumed the role of a user interface designer, overseeing a wide spectrum of design elements. This dual involvement facilitated a cohesive visual identity and user-centered design, enhancing both brand recognition and the overall user experience.

            <h2>
                The genesis of the 3D isotype stemmed from a pencil sketch provided by the brand's director. Leveraging Blender, I extrapolated upon the concept, infusing it with dynamic dimensions. Given the fashion nexus, I judiciously employed metallic textures, evoking a resonating synergy with the client's vision. This fusion of creativity and texture choice harmonized perfectly, aligning with the brand's essence.

                <br>
                Responding to the client's artistic vision, I embarked on an interactive rendition of the model. Rigging the existing creation, I harnessed the power of three.js to imbue it with dynamic behaviors. Actions were meticulously programmed, enabling the model to track mouse movements and respond to clicks, elevating the interactive experience and aligning seamlessly with the client's artistic intent.

            <h2>
                In my capacity as a user interface designer, I collaborated closely with the product designer throughout various phases. This encompassed guiding the formation of the brand's identity, structuring the page's architecture, and advising on visual elements and their placements. Our synergy ensured a harmonious blend of aesthetics and functionality, culminating in a compelling and user-friendly digital presence.
                <br>

                <br>
                In tandem with a graphic designer, I integrated vital visual components into the brand narrative, encompassing a well-defined color palette, expressive icons, and a distinctive type font. This collaborative effort culminated in the creation of a comprehensive style guide, encapsulating these essential elements and delineating their application guidelines for a cohesive and impactful web experience.

            <h2>
                Subsequently, I furnished the client with all visual assets and three.js code. The deployment was facilitated on a personal hosting server. Additionally, I curated a comprehensive style guide in PDF format, encapsulating the brand's visual essence and usage guidelines, further empowering the client with the tools and knowledge to perpetuate a consistent and captivating online presence.
                <br>

                <br>
                The website garnered enthusiastic acclaim upon its launch, reflecting its strong reception. Presently, I am actively engaged in a new project with the same client. The positive response underscores the enduring value of our collaborative efforts, as we continue to explore creative avenues and shape digital experiences that resonate with their audience.
